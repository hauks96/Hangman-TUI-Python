These are only a few of the files included in the django project, taken from the deployment, for demonstration purposes.

Keep in mind that this was my first ever django, or web framework usage attempt in general and many odd things are present. I made this
purely for learning purposes.

Oh and I almost forgot, I made my own (terrible I know) auth class in the views. Please don't abuse my server lol.

If you find anything useful in the code feel free to use it!
